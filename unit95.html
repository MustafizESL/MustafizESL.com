            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "still," "yet," and "already" correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "still" to indicate continuity, "yet" to indicate something expected to happen, and "already" to indicate something that has happened earlier than expected.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Still":</strong> Use "still" to indicate that something is continuing to happen.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Do you still play the piano?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Yet":</strong> Use "yet" to indicate that something has not happened by a particular time but is expected to happen.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: The bus hasn't come yet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Already":</strong> Use "already" to indicate that something has happened earlier than expected.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: He is already here.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Still":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you still play the piano?</li>
                <li>He is still looking for a job.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Yet":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bus hasn't come yet.</li>
                <li>Have you got your (exam) results yet?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Already":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>He is already here.</li>
                <li>No, she has already seen it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercise 95.1: You meet Tina. The last time you saw her was two years ago. You ask her some questions with "still."</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Do you still play the piano?</li>
                <li>2. Do you still live in Clare Street?</li>
                <li>3. Are you still a student?</li>
                <li>4. Have you still got a motorbike? / Do you still have a motorbike?</li>

            <ul>
                <li>1. (before) They were waiting for the bus.
                    <ul>
                        <li>(still) They are still waiting.</li>
                        <li>(yet) The bus hasn't come yet.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>(yet) She hasn't woken up yet.</li>
                        <li>She isn't awake yet. or She hasn't got up yet. or She isn't up yet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>4. (before) They were having dinner. / They were eating.
                    <ul>

            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 95.3: Write questions with "yet."</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. You and Sue are going out together. You are waiting for her to get ready. Perhaps she is ready now. You ask her: Are you ready yet?</li>
                <li>2. You are waiting for Helen to arrive. She wasn't here ten minutes ago. Perhaps she is here now. You ask somebody: Is Helen here yet? or Has Helen arrived/come yet?</li>
                <li>3. Anna did an exam and is waiting for the results. Perhaps she has her results now. You ask her: Have you got your (exam) results yet? / Have you had your results yet? / Have you received your results yet?</li>
                <li>4. A few days ago you spoke to Tom. He wasn't sure where to go on holiday. Perhaps he has decided now. You ask him: Have you decided where to go yet? or Do you know where you're going yet?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 95.4: Complete the sentences. Use "already."</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>2. Does Sarah want to see the film? No, she has already seen it.</li>
                <li>3. I have to see Julia before she goes. It's too late. She has already gone/left.</li>
                <li>4. Do you need a pen? No, thanks. I've already got one. / I already have one.</li>
                <li>5. Shall I pay the bill? No, it's OK. I've already paid (it).</li>
                <li>6. Shall I tell Paul about the meeting? No, he already knows. I told him.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "still" to indicate continuity, "yet" to indicate something expected to happen, and "already" to indicate something that has happened earlier than expected. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
