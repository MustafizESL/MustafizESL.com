            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "one" and "ones" correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "one" and "ones" to refer to specific items without repeating the noun.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "One":</strong> Use "one" to refer to a singular item that has already been mentioned or is understood from context.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I need a pen. Do you have one?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Ones":</strong> Use "ones" to refer to plural items that have already been mentioned or are understood from context.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I like those shoes. Which ones?</li>
            </ul>
