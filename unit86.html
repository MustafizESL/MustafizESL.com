            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use adverbs correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using adverbs to describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, and the difference between adverbs and adjectives.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Adverbs:</strong> Adverbs describe or modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They often end in "-ly."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: He runs quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Adjectives vs. Adverbs:</strong> Adjectives describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: She is a careful driver. (adjective) She drives carefully. (adverb)</li>
            </ul>
