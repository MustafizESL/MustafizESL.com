            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to report speech using "He/She/They said that..." and distinguish between "say/said" and "tell/told".</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on transforming direct speech into reported speech and using the correct forms of "say" and "tell" in sentences.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Reporting Speech:</strong> Use "He/She/They said that..." to report what someone else has said.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: "I've lost my watch." He said that he had lost his watch.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "say/said" and "tell/told":</strong> Use "say/said" to report what someone says without specifying a listener, and use "tell/told" to specify who was informed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: She said she was tired. / She told me she was tired.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Reporting Speech:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I'm very busy." She said that she was very busy.</li>
                <li>"I can't go to the party." She said that she couldn't go to the party.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Using "say/said" and "tell/told":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>He said he was tired.</li>
                <li>Jack told me that you were ill.</li>
            </ul>
