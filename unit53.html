            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use infinitives with "want" and complete sentences using the correct form of verbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on forming sentences with "I want you to..." and "I don't want you to..." as well as completing sentences using the appropriate verb forms.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Infinitives with "want":</strong> Use the base form of the verb with "to" after "want" to express desires or requests.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I want you to come with me.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Completing Sentences with Verbs:</strong> Use the correct form of verbs, whether with or without "to," to complete sentences meaningfully.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Please stay here. I don’t want you to go yet.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
