            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use phrasal verbs with objects, which combine verbs with prepositions like "in," "out," "up," etc., to describe actions involving objects.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these phrasal verbs with objects to form meaningful sentences, making sentences clearer and more descriptive.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Phrasal Verbs with Objects:</strong> Phrasal verbs can be separable or inseparable when used with objects. Separable phrasal verbs allow the object to be placed between the verb and the preposition or after the preposition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I turned on the radio. / I turned the radio on.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>The heating was on but it was too warm, so I switched it off.</li>
