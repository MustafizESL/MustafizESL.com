            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "somebody/someone," "something," "somewhere," "nobody/no-one," "nothing," and "nowhere" correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these pronouns and adverbs to refer to people, things, and places in affirmative and negative contexts.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Somebody/Someone," "Something," and "Somewhere":</strong> Use these words to refer to unspecified people, things, and places in affirmative statements.</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Anybody/Anyone," "Anything," and "Anywhere":</strong> Use these words in negative statements and questions to refer to unspecified people, things, and places.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I didn’t say anything. I'm not going anywhere.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>

                <li>I've lost something.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "somebody/someone," "something," and "somewhere" in affirmative statements, and "nobody/no-one," "nothing," and "nowhere" to express the absence of people, things, and places. We also practiced using "anybody/anyone," "anything," and "anywhere" in negative statements and questions. We formed sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
