            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use phrasal verbs, which combine verbs with prepositions like "in," "out," "up," etc., to describe actions and movements.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these phrasal verbs to form meaningful sentences, making sentences clearer and more descriptive.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Phrasal Verbs:</strong> Phrasal verbs combine a verb with a preposition or an adverb. These combinations create new meanings that are often idiomatic.</p>

                <li>Example: I went to the window and looked out.</li>
            </ul>
