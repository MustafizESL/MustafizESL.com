            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "might" to express possibility and uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "might" to talk about possible future actions and events.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Might" for Possibility:</strong> Use "might" + base form of the verb to express something that is possible but not certain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I might go to the cinema.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Possibility:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's possible that I'll go to the party. → I might go to the party.</li>
                <li>It's possible that it will rain tomorrow. → It might rain tomorrow.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Negative Possibility:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's possible that Mark will not come. → Mark might not come.</li>
                <li>It's possible that I won't finish my work. → I might not finish my work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercise 29.1: Write sentences with "might"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. (It's possible that I'll travel to Spain) I might travel to Spain.</li>
                <li>2. (It's possible that I'll see you next week) I might see you next week.</li>
                <li>3. (It's possible that Sarah will miss the call) Sarah might miss the call.</li>
                <li>4. (It's possible that it will rain this afternoon) It might rain this afternoon.</li>
                <li>5. (It's possible that I'll arrive late) I might arrive late.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Write sentences with "might not"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>6. (It's possible that John will not come to the meeting) John might not come to the meeting.</li>
                <li>7. (It's possible that I won't finish the book today) I might not finish the book today.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 29.2: Somebody is asking you about your plans. You have some ideas, but you are not sure. Choose from the list and write sentences with "I might"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Where are you going for your vacation? I'm not sure. I might go to Italy.</li>
                <li>2. What are you doing this weekend? I don't know. I might go hiking.</li>
                <li>3. When will you visit your friends? I'm not sure. I might visit them on Saturday.</li>
                <li>4. What are you going to have for lunch? I don't know. I might have pizza.</li>
                <li>5. How are you going to get home tonight? I'm not sure. I might take the train.</li>
                <li>6. I hear you received a bonus. What are you going to do with it? I haven't decided yet. I might buy a new laptop.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 29.3: You ask Lisa questions about her plans for tomorrow. Sometimes she is sure, but usually she is not sure</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Are you playing tennis tomorrow? Yes, in the morning.</li>
                <li>2. Are you going out tomorrow evening? Maybe.</li>
                <li>3. Are you going to get up early? Possibly.</li>
                <li>4. Are you working tomorrow? No, I'm not.</li>
                <li>5. Will you be at home tomorrow afternoon? Perhaps.</li>
                <li>6. Are you going to watch a movie? I might.</li>
                <li>7. Are you going out in the evening? Yes, I am.</li>
                <li>8. Are you going shopping? Maybe.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now write about Lisa. Use "might" where necessary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. She's playing tennis tomorrow morning.</li>
                <li>2. She might go out tomorrow evening.</li>
                <li>3. She might get up early.</li>
                <li>4. She isn't working tomorrow.</li>
                <li>5. She might be at home tomorrow afternoon.</li>
                <li>6. She might watch a movie.</li>
                <li>7. She's going out in the evening.</li>
                <li>8. She might go shopping.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 29.4: Write three things that you might do tomorrow</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. I might read a novel.</li>
                <li>2. I might meet a friend for coffee.</li>
                <li>3. I might cook a new recipe for dinner.</li>
            </ul>
