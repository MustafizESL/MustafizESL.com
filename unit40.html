            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to complete sentences using appropriate verbs, negations, and auxiliary verbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using the correct forms of verbs and negations to complete sentences accurately.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Auxiliary Verbs:</strong> Use auxiliary verbs like "is," "have," "can," etc., to complete sentences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Kate wasn't hungry, but we were.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Negations:</strong> Use negative forms like "isn't," "haven't," "can't," etc., to complete sentences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: My sister can play the piano, but I can't.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Auxiliary Verbs for Emphasis:</strong> Use auxiliary verbs like "do," "does," "did," etc., for emphasis in sentences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I don't like hot weather, but Sue does.</li>
            </ul>
