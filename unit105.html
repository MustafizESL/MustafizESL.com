            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use "before," "after," "during," and "while" to describe the timing of actions and events.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these prepositions and conjunctions to indicate the timing and sequence of actions and events, making sentences clearer and more logical.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Before":</strong> Use "before" to indicate that one action or event happens earlier than another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Everybody was nervous before the exam.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "After":</strong> Use "after" to indicate that one action or event happens later than another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I usually work four hours in the morning, and another three hours after lunch.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "During":</strong> Use "during" to indicate that something happens within a specific period of time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Anna went to evening classes to learn German. She learnt a lot during the course.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "While":</strong> Use "while" to indicate that two actions or events happen at the same time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Would you like to sit down while you are waiting?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>

                <li>I felt sick after eating too much chocolate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "During":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anna went to evening classes to learn German. She learnt a lot during the course.</li>
                <li>Somebody broke a window during the night. Did you hear anything?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "While":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Would you like to sit down while you are waiting?</li>
                <li>Gary called while you were out.</li>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "before" to indicate that one action or event happens earlier than another, "after" to indicate that one action or event happens later than another, "during" to indicate that something happens within a specific period of time, and "while" to indicate that two actions or events happen at the same time. We practiced forming sentences using these prepositions and conjunctions to enhance clarity and logic in writing.</p>
