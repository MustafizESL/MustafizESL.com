            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "some," "most," "all," "none," and "any" correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these quantifiers to refer to different amounts or portions of something.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Some" and "Most":</strong> Use "some" to refer to an unspecified quantity that is less than the whole, and "most" to refer to the majority of something.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Some people never stop talking. Most children like playing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "All":</strong> Use "all" to refer to the entire group or total amount.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: All the students failed the exam.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "None":</strong> Use "none" to refer to the absence of something.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: None of my friends are married.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Any":</strong> Use "any" in negative statements and questions to refer to an unspecified quantity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Do you know any of the people in this photograph?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "some" to refer to an unspecified quantity that is less than the whole, "most" to refer to the majority of something, "all" to refer to the entire group or total amount, "none" to refer to the absence of something, and "any" in negative statements and questions to refer to an unspecified quantity. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
