            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "both" to refer to two people or things together, "either" to refer to one or the other of two people or things, and "neither" to refer to not one nor the other of two people or things. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
