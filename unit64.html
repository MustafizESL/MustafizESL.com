            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use possessive nouns and pronouns correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using possessive forms to indicate ownership and relationships, and how to structure sentences using these forms.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Possessive Nouns:</strong> Possessive nouns show ownership and are formed by adding an apostrophe and an "s" to a noun.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Brian is Helen's husband.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Possessive Pronouns:</strong> Possessive pronouns show ownership and replace nouns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: This car is mine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Sarah is Daniel's mother.</li>
                <li>Helen is Brian's wife.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Using Possessive Pronouns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whose is this? Alice's.</li>
                <li>Whose books are these? Mine.</li>
            </ul>
