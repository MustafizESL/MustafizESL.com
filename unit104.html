            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use "from... to," "until," "since," and "for" to describe periods of time and durations.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these prepositions and conjunctions to indicate time periods, durations, and specific points in time.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "From... to":</strong> Use "from... to" to indicate the start and end of a time period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Alex lived in Canada from 1991 to 1999.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Until":</strong> Use "until" to indicate a continuous action or state up to a specific point in time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Alex lived in Canada until 1999.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Since":</strong> Use "since" to indicate the starting point of an action or state that continues to the present.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Alex has lived in England since 1999.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "For":</strong> Use "for" to indicate the duration of an action or state.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Alex lived in Canada for eight years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use "from... to" to indicate the start and end of a time period, "until" to indicate a continuous action or state up to a specific point in time, "since" to indicate the starting point of an action or state that continues to the present, and "for" to indicate the duration of an action or state. We practiced forming sentences using these prepositions and conjunctions to enhance clarity and precision in writing.</p>
