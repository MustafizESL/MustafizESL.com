            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to express future plans and arrangements using the present continuous and present simple tenses.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>

                <li>Example: I am meeting my friend tomorrow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present Simple for Scheduled Events:</strong> Use the present simple for events that are on a fixed schedule.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: The train leaves at 8:00 AM.</li>
            </ul>
