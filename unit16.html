            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use the present perfect tense with the adverbs "just," "already," and "yet" to describe actions that have recently happened or actions that are expected to happen.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on the formation and usage of the present perfect tense with "just," "already," and "yet."</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Forming the Present Perfect:</strong> Use "has" or "have" followed by the past participle of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I have finished my homework. / She has seen that movie.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "just":</strong> Indicates that the action happened a short time ago.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: They have just arrived.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "already":</strong> Indicates that the action happened sooner than expected or before now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: She has already finished her work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "yet":</strong> Used in negative sentences and questions to talk about something expected to happen.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Have you finished your homework yet? / I haven't finished it yet.</li>
            </ul>
