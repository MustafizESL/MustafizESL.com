            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use "to" and "-ing" forms of verbs in different contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on identifying when to use the infinitive (to work) and gerund (-ing form) of verbs based on the structure of sentences.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Infinitives (to + verb):</strong> Use the base form of the verb with "to" (to do, to go).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I want to go to the beach.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Gerunds (verb + -ing):</strong> Use the -ing form of the verb when it functions as a noun (doing, going).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I enjoy reading.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Infinitives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I want to see you again soon.</li>
                <li>He promised to be here on time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Gerunds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I enjoy dancing.</li>
                <li>Please stop talking.</li>
            </ul>
