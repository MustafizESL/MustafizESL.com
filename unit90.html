            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to form and use comparatives and superlatives correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using comparatives to compare two things or people and superlatives to indicate the highest degree among three or more things or people.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Comparatives:</strong> Comparatives are used to compare two things or people. They often end in "-er" for one-syllable adjectives and "more" for longer adjectives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: bigger, more expensive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Superlatives:</strong> Superlatives indicate the highest degree among three or more things or people. They often end in "-est" for one-syllable adjectives and "most" for longer adjectives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: biggest, most expensive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Comparatives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A is bigger than D.</li>
                <li>D is more expensive than A.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Superlatives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A is the biggest.</li>
                <li>C is the most expensive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>

                <li>1. big/small
                    <ul>
                        <li>(A/D) A is bigger than D.</li>
                        <li>(A) A is the biggest.</li>

                        <li>(B) B is the shortest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>3. young/old
                    <ul>
                        <li>(D/C) D is younger than C.</li>
                        <li>(B) B is the youngest.</li>
                        <li>(C) C is the oldest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>4. expensive/cheap
                    <ul>
                        <li>(D/A) D is more expensive than A.</li>
                        <li>(C) C is the most expensive.</li>
                        <li>(A) A is the cheapest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>5. good/bad
                    <ul>
                        <li>(A/C) A is better than C.</li>
                        <li>(A) A is the best.</li>
                        <li>(D) D is the worst.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use comparatives to compare two things or people and superlatives to indicate the highest degree among three or more things or people. We formed comparatives by adding "-er" for one-syllable adjectives and using "more" for longer adjectives. We formed superlatives by adding "-est" for one-syllable adjectives and using "most" for longer adjectives. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
