            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use the past continuous and past simple tenses to describe actions that happened in the past.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on the formation and usage of the past continuous and past simple tenses, and how to use them together.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Forming the Past Continuous:</strong> Use "was" or "were" followed by the -ing form of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I was watching TV. / They were playing soccer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Forming the Past Simple:</strong> Use the past form of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I watched TV. / They played soccer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Past Continuous and Past Simple Together:</strong> The past continuous describes a longer action that was in progress, while the past simple describes a shorter action that happened during the longer action.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I was watching TV when the phone rang.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Past Continuous:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was reading a book.</li>
                <li>She was cooking dinner.</li>
                <li>They were playing basketball.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Past Simple:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I read a book.</li>
                <li>She cooked dinner.</li>
                <li>They played basketball.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Past Continuous and Past Simple Together:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was reading a book when she called.</li>
                <li>She was cooking dinner when the power went out.</li>
                <li>They were playing basketball when it started to rain.</li>
