            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "when," "while," "before," and "after" correctly to connect actions and events in time.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using these conjunctions to indicate the timing of actions and events, making writing clearer and more logical.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "When":</strong> Use "when" to indicate the time at which something happens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: When I went out, it was raining.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "While":</strong> Use "while" to indicate that two actions happen at the same time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: While we were asleep, somebody broke into the house.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Before":</strong> Use "before" to indicate that one action happens earlier than another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: They looked both ways before they crossed the road.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "After":</strong> Use "after" to indicate that one action happens later than another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: After they got married, they went to live in New Zealand.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
