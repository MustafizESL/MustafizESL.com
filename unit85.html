            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use adjectives and nouns correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using adjectives to describe nouns and the proper order of words in sentences.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Adjectives:</strong> Adjectives describe or modify nouns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: green jacket, sharp knife.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Nouns:</strong> Nouns are the names of people, places, things, or ideas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: house, languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Word Order:</strong> The typical word order in English is subject + verb + object. Adjectives usually come before nouns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: They live in a new house.</li>
            </ul>
