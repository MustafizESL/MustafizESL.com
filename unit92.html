            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "too" and "enough" correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "too" to indicate an excess amount or degree and "enough" to indicate sufficiency in quantity or degree.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Too":</strong> "Too" is used to indicate that there is more than is necessary or acceptable. It can be used with adjectives or adverbs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: The music is too loud.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Enough":</strong> "Enough" is used to indicate that there is as much or as many as needed. It can be used with nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: He isn’t tall enough.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
