            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use conjunctions (and/but/or/so/because) correctly to connect ideas and sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using conjunctions to connect ideas, sentences, and clauses, making writing clearer and more coherent.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Conjunctions:</strong> Conjunctions are words that connect words, phrases, or clauses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>And:</strong> Used to add information.</li>
                <li><strong>But:</strong> Used to show contrast.</li>
                <li><strong>Or:</strong> Used to present alternatives.</li>
                <li><strong>So:</strong> Used to show result or consequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Because:</strong> Used to show reason.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Conjunctions:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>I bought a newspaper, but I didn’t read it.</li>
                <li>Do you want me to come with you, or shall I wait here?</li>
                <li>It was very hot, so he opened the window.</li>
                <li>They couldn't play tennis because it was raining.</li>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use conjunctions to connect words, phrases, or clauses. We practiced forming sentences using conjunctions to enhance clarity and coherence in writing. Use "and" to add information, "but" to show contrast, "or" to present alternatives, "so" to show result, and "because" to show reason.</p>
