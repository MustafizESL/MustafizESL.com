            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "there was" and "there were" to describe the presence or absence of things in the past.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "there was" for singular nouns and "there were" for plural nouns to talk about what existed or did not exist in the past.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "There was" for Singular Nouns:</strong> Use "there was" to indicate the presence of a single item in the past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There was a cat on the sofa.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "There were" for Plural Nouns:</strong> Use "there were" to indicate the presence of multiple items in the past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There were several books on the table.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Negative Forms:</strong> Use "there wasn't" for singular nouns and "there weren't" for plural nouns to indicate the absence of something in the past.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There wasn't a phone in the room. / There weren't any chairs left.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Affirmative:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li>There were many people at the concert.</li>
            </ul>
