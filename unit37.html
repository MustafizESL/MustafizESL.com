            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "there is" and "there are" to describe the presence or absence of things.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "there is" for singular nouns and "there are" for plural nouns to talk about what exists or does not exist.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "There is" for Singular Nouns:</strong> Use "there is" to indicate the presence of a single item.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There is a book on the table.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "There are" for Plural Nouns:</strong> Use "there are" to indicate the presence of multiple items.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There are three chairs in the room.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Negative Forms:</strong> Use "there isn't" for singular nouns and "there aren't" for plural nouns to indicate the absence of something.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: There isn't a cat in the garden. / There aren't any apples left.</li>
            </ul>
