            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use object pronouns and possessive adjectives correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using object pronouns and possessive adjectives to make sentences clear and concise.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Object Pronouns:</strong> Object pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition and are used as the object of a verb or preposition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I know him.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using Possessive Adjectives:</strong> Possessive adjectives show ownership and are used before a noun.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: It's my book.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Object Pronouns:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I know him, but I can't remember his name.</li>
                <li>Have you seen her?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Using Possessive Adjectives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We invited her to stay with us at our house.</li>
                <li>He gave me his address and I gave him mine.</li>
