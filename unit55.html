            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use prepositions and verb forms correctly to complete sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "to," "on," and "for" appropriately, as well as forming sentences with verbs in the -ing form.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Prepositions:</strong> Use "to," "on," and "for" to indicate direction, location, purpose, or reason.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I'm going to China next week.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using the -ing Form:</strong> Use the -ing form of verbs to describe actions in progress or habitual activities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Richard often goes sailing.</li>
            </ul>
