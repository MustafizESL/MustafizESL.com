            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to form and use comparatives correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using comparatives to compare two things or people and how to form comparatives from adjectives.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Comparatives:</strong> Comparatives are used to compare two things or people. They often end in "-er" for one-syllable adjectives and "more" for longer adjectives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: taller, more interesting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Comparatives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>heavy → heavier</li>
                <li>big → bigger</li>
                <li>more beautiful</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
            <p><strong>Exercise 87.1: Look at the pictures and write the comparative (older / more interesting etc.)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. heavy → heavier</li>
                <li>2. big → bigger</li>
                <li>3. slow → slower</li>
                <li>4. expensive → more expensive</li>
                <li>5. high → higher</li>
                <li>6. dangerous → more dangerous</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 87.2: Write the comparative</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. old → older</li>
                <li>2. strong → stronger</li>
                <li>3. happy → happier</li>
                <li>4. modern → more modern</li>
                <li>5. important → more important</li>
                <li>6. good → better</li>
                <li>7. large → larger</li>
                <li>8. serious → more serious</li>
                <li>9. pretty → prettier</li>
                <li>10. crowded → more crowded</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 87.3: Write the opposite</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. younger → older</li>
                <li>2. colder → hotter/warmer</li>
                <li>3. cheaper → more expensive</li>
                <li>4. better → worse</li>
                <li>5. nearer → further</li>
                <li>6. easier → more difficult/harder</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Exercise 87.4: Complete the sentences. Use a comparative</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Helen's car isn't very big. She wants a bigger one.</li>
                <li>2. My job isn't very interesting. I want to do something more interesting.</li>
                <li>3. You're not very tall. Your brother is taller.</li>
                <li>4. David doesn't work very hard. I work harder.</li>
                <li>5. My chair isn't very comfortable. Yours is more comfortable.</li>
                <li>6. Your idea isn't very good. My idea is better.</li>
                <li>7. These flowers aren't very nice. The blue ones are nicer.</li>
                <li>8. My bag isn't very heavy. Your bag is heavier.</li>
                <li>9. I'm not very interested in art. I'm more interested in history.</li>
                <li>10. It isn't very warm today. It was warmer yesterday.</li>
                <li>11. These tomatoes don't taste very good. The other ones tasted better.</li>
                <li>12. Britain isn't very big. France is bigger.</li>
                <li>13. London isn't very beautiful. Paris is more beautiful.</li>
                <li>14. This knife isn't very sharp. Have you got a sharper one?</li>
                <li>15. People today aren't very polite. In the past they were more polite.</li>
                <li>16. The weather isn't too bad today. Often it is much worse.</li>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use comparatives to compare two things or people. We formed comparatives by adding "-er" for one-syllable adjectives and using "more" for longer adjectives. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
