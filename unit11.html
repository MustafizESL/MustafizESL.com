            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use the past simple tense to describe actions that happened in the past.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit covers the formation and usage of the past simple tense with regular and irregular verbs.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Forming the Past Simple:</strong> The past simple tense is typically formed by adding -ed to the base form of regular verbs. Irregular verbs have unique past forms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Verbs:</strong> play → played, work → worked</li>
                <li><strong>Irregular Verbs:</strong> go → went, have → had</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Positive Statements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I visited my grandparents last weekend.</li>
                <li>She watched a movie yesterday.</li>
                <li>They went to the park.</li>
                <li>He had a big breakfast this morning.</li>
            </ul>
