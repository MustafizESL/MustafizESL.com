            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "too" and "either" for agreement and how to respond with "So..." and "Neither..." to show shared experiences or opinions.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "too" and "either" to express agreement and using "So..." and "Neither..." to respond in conversation.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "Too" for Positive Agreement:</strong> Use "too" to agree with a positive statement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I'm happy. I'm happy too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Either" for Negative Agreement:</strong> Use "either" to agree with a negative statement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry either.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Responding with "So...":</strong> Use "So..." to show that you have the same positive experience or opinion as someone else.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I'm thirsty. So am I.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Responding with "Neither...":</strong> Use "Neither..." to show that you have the same negative experience or opinion as someone else.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I can't go to the party. Neither can I.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>

            </ul>

            <p><strong>Responding with "So..." and "Neither...":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I need a holiday. So do I.</li>
