            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use infinitives and prepositions to form complete sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on completing sentences with the correct form of verbs and prepositions, using "to" or "for" where appropriate.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Infinitives (to + verb):</strong> Use the base form of the verb with "to" to indicate purpose or intention.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I went to the post office to get some stamps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "for":</strong> Use "for" to indicate the purpose or reason for an action.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I'm going to London for an interview.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>I went for a walk to get some fresh air.</li>
            </ul>
