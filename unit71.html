            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use articles (the, a/an) correctly with places.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on the rules for using articles with place names and locations, and how to use them in sentences appropriately.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Articles with Places:</strong> Some places do not require an article, while others do. The rules depend on the type of place and the context.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>No Article:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>He's in bed.</li>
                <li>She's in hospital.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>With Article ("the"):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They're at the cinema.</li>
                <li>I need to go to the bank.</li>
            </ul>
