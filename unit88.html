            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use comparatives with "than" to compare two things or people. We formed comparatives by adding "-er" for one-syllable adjectives and using "more" for longer adjectives. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
