            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use pronouns like "him," "her," "them," etc., correctly in sentences.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit provides practice on using object pronouns in different contexts, including forming questions, short answers, and sentence completion.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Object Pronouns:</strong> Object pronouns are used to replace nouns that receive the action of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I → me</li>
                <li>He → him</li>
                <li>She → her</li>
                <li>We → us</li>
                <li>They → them</li>
                <li>You → you (no change)</li>
                <li>It → it (no change)</li>
            </ul>
