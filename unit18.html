            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use the present perfect tense to describe actions or situations that started in the past and continue in the present. They will also learn to compare the present simple, present continuous, present perfect, and present perfect continuous tenses.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on expressing duration using the present perfect tense with the phrase "How long have you ...?" and comparing it with other tenses.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Present Perfect Tense:</strong> Use "has" or "have" followed by the past participle of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I have worked here for three years. / She has studied at this school since 2015.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present Simple vs. Present Perfect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Simple: Describes a current state or habitual action.</li>
                <li>Example: Mary lives in New York.</li>
                <li>Present Perfect: Describes a state that started in the past and continues in the present.</li>
                <li>Example: She has lived in New York for five years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present Continuous vs. Present Perfect Continuous:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Continuous: Describes an action happening right now.</li>
                <li>Example: They are playing soccer.</li>
                <li>Present Perfect Continuous: Describes an action that started in the past and is still happening now.</li>
                <li>Example: They have been playing soccer for an hour.</li>
