            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use adverbs of frequency (often, never, always, etc.) and their placement in sentences correctly.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using adverbs of frequency to describe how often an action occurs and understanding their correct placement in sentences.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Adverbs of Frequency:</strong> Adverbs of frequency describe how often an action occurs. They include words like always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, and never.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Paul often plays tennis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Placement of Adverbs:</strong> Adverbs of frequency typically come before the main verb but after the verb "to be."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: He always gets up early. (before the main verb)</li>
                <li>Example: He is always on time. (after the verb "to be")</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Adverbs of Frequency:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paul often plays tennis.</li>
                <li>He always gets up early.</li>
                <li>He is never late for work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Also":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yes, and I also play tennis.</li>
                <li>Yes, and I also speak French.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Using "Both" and "All":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They both live in London.</li>
                <li>They are all married.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this unit, we learned how to use adverbs of frequency to describe how often an action occurs. We also learned the correct placement of adverbs of frequency in sentences, using "also" to add additional information, and using "both" and "all" to refer to two or more subjects. We practiced forming sentences using these structures to enhance communication skills.</p>
