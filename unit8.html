            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will be able to distinguish between the present simple and present continuous tenses and use them accurately in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on understanding when to use the present simple tense and when to use the present continuous tense.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>The present simple tense is used for habitual actions and general truths, while the present continuous tense is used for actions happening right now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Simple:</strong> I work, you work, he/she/it works, we work, they work</li>
                <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> I am working, you are working, he/she/it is working, we are working, they are working</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Present Simple:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I read books every day.</li>

                <li>They live in New York.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>I am reading a book right now.</li>
                <li>She is playing the guitar at the moment.</li>
                <li>They are living in New York for the summer.</li>
