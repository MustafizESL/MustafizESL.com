            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "the" correctly with geographical names and places.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on the rules for using "the" with names of countries, continents, rivers, oceans, mountains, and other geographical features.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Using "The" with Geographical Names:</strong> Some geographical names require "the," while others do not. The rules depend on the type of geographical feature and the specific name.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>With "The":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Atlantic is between Africa and America.</li>
                <li>The Andes are mountains in South America.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Without "The":</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cairo is the capital of Egypt.</li>
                <li>Sweden is a country in northern Europe.</li>
            </ul>
