            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to use "I have" and "I’ve got" to talk about possessions, relationships, and characteristics.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit covers the formation and usage of "I have", "I’ve got", "I don't have", "I haven’t got", "Do you have?", and "Have you got?".</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Forming "I have" and "I’ve got":</strong> Both "I have" and "I’ve got" are used to indicate possession. They can be used interchangeably, but "I’ve got" is more common in informal spoken English.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I have:</strong> I have a car.</li>
                <li><strong>I’ve got:</strong> I’ve got a car.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Forming "I don't have" and "I haven’t got":</strong> "I don't have" and "I haven’t got" are used to indicate the absence of possession. "I don't have" is more common in American English, while "I haven’t got" is more common in British English.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I don't have:</strong> I don't have a car.</li>
                <li><strong>I haven’t got:</strong> I haven’t got a car.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Forming Questions with "Do you have?" and "Have you got?":</strong> To ask about possession, we use "Do you have?" or "Have you got?". "Do you have?" is more common in American English, while "Have you got?" is more common in British English.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do you have?</strong> Do you have a car?</li>
                <li><strong>Have you got?</strong> Have you got a car?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Positive Statements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a cat.</li>

                <li>She has a new job.</li>
