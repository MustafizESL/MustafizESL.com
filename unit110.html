            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to correctly use prepositions to describe movement and direction.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using prepositions to indicate movement from one place to another and to describe the direction of that movement, making sentences clearer and more precise.</p>

            <p><strong>Using Prepositions for Movement and Direction:</strong> Prepositions like past, under, up, down, along, into, out of, over, through, across, off, round/around, from, on, and into are used to describe the direction and movement from one place to another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Go past the church.</li>
            </ul>
