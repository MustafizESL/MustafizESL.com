            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to form questions with "who" and "what," as well as other question types involving prepositions, which, and asking for descriptions.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using "who" and "what" to form questions that inquire about people and things, as well as other question structures.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Questions with "Who" and "What" as the Subject:</strong> Use "who" and "what" to ask about the subject of a sentence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Somebody broke the window. Who broke the window?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions with "Who" and "What" as the Object:</strong> Use "who" and "what" to ask about the object of a sentence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: I bought something. What did you buy?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions with Prepositions:</strong> Form questions where the preposition comes at the end.</p>

                <li>Example: I went to the cinema with someone. Who did you go to the cinema with?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions with "Which":</strong> Use "which" to ask about a specific item or person from a known set.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Tom's father is in a hospital. Which hospital is he in?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Questions Asking for Descriptions:</strong> Use "What is/are... like?" to ask for descriptions.</p>
