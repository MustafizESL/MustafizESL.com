            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> By the end of this unit, learners will understand how to form and use conditional sentences correctly in various contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This unit focuses on using conditional sentences to describe hypothetical situations and their potential outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p><strong>Conditional Sentences:</strong> Conditional sentences describe a condition and its possible outcome. They often use "if" to introduce the condition.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: If I knew the answer, I'd tell you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p><strong>Using Conditionals:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If he had the money, he would buy a fast car.</li>
                <li>If she knew, she'd be angry.</li>
